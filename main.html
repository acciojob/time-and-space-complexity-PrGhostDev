    <h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
      Time complexity is an essential concept in computer science that measures
      the efficiency of an algorithm's execution. It indicates how the execution
      time of an algorithm increases with the input size. Efficient algorithms
      strive to achieve lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution for
      larger inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Space Complexity</b> is another critical aspect to consider when
      evaluating algorithms. It refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses
      during its execution. Algorithms with lower space complexity utilize less
      memory, making them more efficient in memory usage. For example, an
      algorithm with <b>O(n)</b> space complexity indicates that the memory
      usage grows linearly with the input size.
